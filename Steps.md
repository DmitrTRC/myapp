Next Steps and Considerations:

Backend API: Since the api_service.dart is created, you will need to develop the backend API according to the requirements I've outlined. This will include endpoints for all the methods you need.
SQLite Implementation: Now that the sqlite_service.dart is created, you need to properly implement all the logic of saving, deleting and modifying data in the database.
Complete UI: The UI screens I've created are basic. You'll need to flesh them out with proper widgets, styling, and user interaction logic.
Navigation: Implement navigation between the different screens.
Logic for all the screens: Implement the logic to show data on the screens and interaction with the user.
Error Handling: Add proper error handling throughout the app for both API calls and database interactions.
Authentication: Implement a secure user authentication system.
Testing: Write unit and widget tests to ensure the app works as expected.
Security: Implement security best practices throughout the application.
Deployment: Deploy the application to iOS, android and web.
I've taken the initial steps of setting up a well-structured Flutter project for your "Patrol Assistant" app. Let me know what else you would like to do.
